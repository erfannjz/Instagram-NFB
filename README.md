# Instagram Non-Follow Back (NFB) Tool

This web application helps Instagram users identify accounts that do not follow them back. It extracts information from two JSON files: one containing your followers and the other containing the accounts you are following. By comparing these two lists, the tool provides a straightforward way to see who you may want to unfollow.
